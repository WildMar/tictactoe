# WELCOME TO TIC-TAC-TOE!
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Single Page Application (SPA), which you can run and play the classic game of tic-tac-toe against a computer in your very own browser.

Tic-tac-toe is a game in which you are given a board consisting of a 3X3 grid and you and one other player take turns selecting a position on the grid (Player 1 would place an "O", Player 2 would place an "X"). Whoever gets 3 in a row (diagonally, vertically or horizontally) wins!
